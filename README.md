## Tech Stack: OpenAI (GPT-4), JavaScript, FastAPI and MongoDB
Problem Statement:
In the field of computer programming, solving coding problems is an essential skill for developers to improve their problem-solving abilities and expand their knowledge. However, many users face challenges in organizing their problem-solving journey and determining the optimal order in which to solve the remaining problems in a specific category.
Our project aims to address this problem by developing a solution that takes in a user's solved and unsolved problem list within a certain category of problems and provides them with an overall score and a suggested order in which to tackle the remaining problems. The overall score will be calculated based on the user's performance in solving the problems, considering factors such as completion time, accuracy, and complexity of the solutions.
Key Objectives:
1.	User Input: Leetcode Session cookie and CSRF token
2.	Scoring Algorithm: We have used OpenAI APIs to design an algorithm that calculates an overall score for the user based on their performance in solving the problems. The scoring algorithm will consider factors such as completion time, accuracy, and complexity of the solutions.
3.	Problem Prioritization: Our system will provide users with a suggested order in which to solve the remaining problems within the category. The prioritization will be based on the user's overall score and the difficulty level of the unsolved problems.
4.	User Interface: We will develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system, and view their overall score and suggested order of problem-solving.
5.	Performance and Scalability: Our solution will be designed to handle a large number of problems and users efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
By providing users with an overall score and a suggested order for solving the remaining problems in a specific Leetcode category, our solution will help users effectively organize their learning journey, focus on areas that need improvement, and enhance their problem-solving skills in a systematic manner
